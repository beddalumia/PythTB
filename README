PythTB is a software package providing a Python implementation of the
tight-binding approximation. It can be used to construct and solve
tight-binding models of the electronic structure of systems of
arbitrary dimensionality (crystals, slabs, ribbons, clusters, etc.),
and is rich with features for computing Berry phases and related
properties.

Here we provide a fork of the project, with all the released development
history, as found in the primary location for the package:

where the most up-to-date docs can be found.
